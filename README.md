# Buffet version 0.3

Program I'm developing which will just be a "buffet" of random features I put in it. No GUI so far, just runs in the console for now.

Designing it to be modular and easy to add to, instructions to add programs to it are in the main file

Programs so far:

Basic Calculator

Basic Stack Demo

Guessing Game (Higher or Lower)

Simple Pokemon Battle (Can add any pokemon in the file as long as the arguments are right and its added to the list of pokemon)
